/* ── FAQ ── */
const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is Tesamorelin and how is it different from HGH?",
    a: "Tesamorelin is a synthetic analog of Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GHRH) — the upstream signal that instructs the pituitary to produce GH in natural pulses. Exogenous HGH bypasses this entirely, suppressing your pituitary's own production and delivering a non-physiologic flat-line GH level. Tesamorelin preserves pulsatility, which is how GH is meant to work. This distinction matters for both efficacy and long-term safety.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Tesamorelin compare to MK-677?",
    a: "MK-677 (Ibutamoren) is a ghrelin mimetic — it stimulates GH release through a different receptor pathway (GHSR-1a) and tends to produce sustained, non-pulsatile GH elevation. It also significantly increases appetite and can worsen insulin sensitivity. Tesamorelin works at the GHRHR receptor, produces physiologic GH pulses, has a well-characterized Phase 3 safety profile, and is FDA-approved. MK-677 is not FDA-approved and lacks equivalent human trial data.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will Tesamorelin affect my blood sugar?",
    a: "GH is inherently insulin-antagonistic, so modest fasting glucose elevations are possible — particularly in individuals with pre-existing insulin resistance. In Phase 3 trials, HbA1c increases were small and reversible on discontinuation. We monitor fasting glucose and HbA1c at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Individuals with uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c >8.0%) are not candidates for this protocol.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is prescribing Tesamorelin off-label legal?",
    a: "Tesamorelin (Egrifta) is FDA-approved for HIV-associated lipodystrophy. Prescribing it for age-related visceral adiposity, GH decline, or cognitive optimization is off-label. Off-label prescribing is legal, common, and well-established in U.S. medical practice — physicians exercise clinical judgment to prescribe approved drugs for non-approved indications when evidence supports it. All Aurelius protocols are prescribed by licensed physicians who document clinical rationale.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I inject Tesamorelin?",
    a: "Tesamorelin is administered as a once-daily subcutaneous injection, typically into the abdomen, rotating sites. The needle is 28–31 gauge, 5/16 inch — comparable to an insulin pen. Your nurse onboarding session covers reconstitution, injection technique, site rotation, and sharps disposal. Most patients report the injection is nearly painless within the first week.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long until I see results?",
    a: "IGF-1 levels typically normalize within 4–6 weeks. Measurable visceral fat reduction on imaging is generally observed at 12 weeks, with the most significant changes at 26 weeks per Phase 3 trial data. Energy and sleep improvements are often reported within the first 4–8 weeks. Body composition retesting is scheduled at 12 and 26 weeks.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the contraindications?",
    a: "Absolute contraindications include: active or suspected malignancy, pituitary tumor or structural pituitary disorder, active proliferative or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, pregnancy, and known hypersensitivity to Tesamorelin or mannitol. Relative contraindications include uncontrolled HbA1c >8.0% and recent major surgery. Your physician reviews all contraindications during the intake process.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I stop the protocol?",
    a: "Visceral fat reduction is not permanent — studies show VAT returns toward baseline within 12 weeks of discontinuation. This is consistent with Tesamorelin's mechanism: it restores a signal, not a structure. Many patients cycle on for 26 weeks, take a break, and resume. Your physician will discuss maintenance strategies based on your 26-week body composition retest.",

                Most GH-related compounds work downstream — either injecting GH directly or stimulating its release through ghrelin pathways. Tesamorelin is different: it is a synthetic analog of GHRH, the hypothalamic hormone that initiates the entire cascade. This means your pituitary remains active, your feedback loops remain intact, and GH is released in natural pulses — not a pharmacologic flood.
